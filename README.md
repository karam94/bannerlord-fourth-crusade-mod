# Mount & Blade: Bannerlord - 4th Crusade Mod

![Current Map](/images/4thCrusadeMod-FullMap-min.png)

## Overview

The Kingdom of Calradia now represents a fictional representation of the world, post-Third Crusade. Saladin has captured the Holy Kingdom of Jerusalem and as a result, the Islamic world has been rallied, resulting in the Mohads combining together with the Ayyubid Dynasty in an attempt to capitalise on the fresh split between the Holy Roman Empire & Byzantine Empire due to disagreements around the planned Fourth Crusade in Europe towards Constantinople.

Like-wise, the Nordic states have also come to an agreement to re-unite the Scandinavian states and form a Second Anglo-Scandinavian Empire alongside the expanding Second Bulgarian Empire, with both trying to also capitalise on the vulnerable Holy Roman Empire.

The Mongols have destroyed the remainder of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum from the East whilst the Angevin Empire struggle to hold off the Kingdom of France to the West side of the Holy Roman Empire.

Which side will you take? Will you re-unite the Holy Roman Empire under a single banner once again, then embark on a journey to recapture the Holy Land of Jerusalem? Is it time for the Nordic states to roll back the years and take control? Or will you become a vassal of the mighty Saladin and have to juggle a Mongol invasion from your East whilst attempting to expand further in to Spain, in the West?

## Inspiration

Having started a save, I felt like the fictional characters & cities was resulting in a lack of immersion for myself, so I decided to try and make small cosmetic changes to the game to better represent what I believe, the developers have tried to re-create. I felt that if I felt this way, then surely others probably will too and therefore I've decided to release this as a mod.

Whilst we know that Calradia in Warband was based around a fictional, modern-day Turkey... the new Calradia in Bannerlord looked far too much like the North-Eastern Hemisphere for me to ignore.

The story line around the "Empire" splitting, coinciding with Razih (roughly situated where Jerusalem would) and Unqid's strong physical likeness to Saladin, with a Mongol invasion from the East, also seemed to be somewhat inspired roughly by the state of the world in the early 13th Century. So, I have tried to recreate this with some slight fictional tweaks to suit the game.

## Installation

Extract or drag the folders `zzFourthCrusadeBannerlord` and `SandBox` in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules`.
When asked to overwrite existing files, accept to do so (this is due to some files currently not being moddable in early access).
Ensure to select the "Fourth Crusade Bannerlord" mod in the M&B: Bannerlord launcher, order it at the bottom.

### Changes:

- Kingdoms & cultures have been renamed:
  - Aserai = Ayyubid Dynasty (Includes the Mohads)
  - Khuzaits = Mongol Empire
  - Southern = Byzantine Empire
  - Northern = Second Bulgarian Empire (Serbia/Bulgaria/Hungary/Poland)
  - Western = Holy Roman Empire
  - Battania = Kingdom of France
  - Vlandia = Angevin Empire
  - Sturgia = Second Anglo-Scandinavian Empire (Nordic states have re-combined)
- Mass majority of cities & towns have been renamed to resemble real life cities & towns.
- Cities & towns have been assigned to the correct starting empires (e.g. Tripoli, despite being surrounded by - Ayyubid cities, belongs to the Byzantines). Their in-game sizes however may not currently be reflective of their actual sizes however and this is a work in progress.
- All main starting Rulers & Lords have been renamed to reflect the new kingdoms.

- Change owner of main cities to main clan.

### Reported Bug Fixes:

- Fixed bug that causes game to crash when walking around a city.
- Fixed bug where Alexios still had Rhagaea's body.

### Todo:

- Tweak cities & towns to better represent their actual sizes/historical significance.
- Tweak cities & towns to have more accurate bounded settlements.
- Debug clan names not changing.
- Investigate work needed to rename troops.
- Investigate if we need to change any more colour information for kingdoms.
